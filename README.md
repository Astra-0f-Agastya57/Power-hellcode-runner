# Power-shellcode-runner
PowerShell script that utilizes WinAPI to bypass Windows Defender. It downloads shellcode from a specified URL, loads it directly into memory, and executes it using WinAPI calls. Any compatible shellcode or payload extension can lead to successful shell access or remote command execution on the target system.


Shellcode should replace the $url in the script and should run to execute.
